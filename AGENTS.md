# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

Guide future agents working on this VS Code extension.

This project is a minimal TypeScript VS Code extension that provides a native sidebar UI for the Pi coding agent.

## Living Document

Keep this file current when durable, project-specific learnings arrive.

Update `AGENTS.md` when a new instruction would help future agents avoid repeated research, preserve working integration details, or follow an established local pattern.

Do not add transient notes, guesses, one-off debugging observations, or broad generic coding advice.

## Current Architecture

- `package.json` defines a VS Code extension with an Activity Bar view container named `Tau`.
- The extension is TypeScript, CommonJS, and compiles `src` to `out`.
- `src/extension.ts` is only the activation entrypoint and command/view registration.
- `src/piChatViewProvider.ts` owns VS Code webview/provider integration, focus handling, notifications, workspace `cwd` lookup, and Tau session manager lifecycle.
- `src/sessions/tauSessionManager.ts` owns the open-session switcher model and coordinates multiple live `PiChatController` instances so background sessions can keep running; open-session controller state types stay local to that manager.
- `src/sessions/sessionViewController.ts`, `src/sessions/sessionHistoryController.ts`, `src/sessions/sessionClientActions.ts`, and `src/sessions/sessionFormatting.ts` own extension-side session UI state/actions, history adoption, background session-client actions, and session formatting.
- `src/piChatController.ts` owns Tau chat orchestration; controller helpers for parsing, type guards, error classification, shared controller option types, transcript formatting, Pi client lifecycle, local slash commands, and RPC event handling live under `src/controller/`.
- `src/chatSession.ts` owns pure in-memory transcript/session state and has no VS Code or Pi process dependencies.
- `src/sidebar/chatWebview.ts` owns extension-host public sidebar webview HTML composition and message parsing.
- `src/webviewProtocol/types.ts` owns extension-host/sidebar webview message, state, and protocol types shared by the provider, controller, sidebar HTML helpers, and tests.
- `src/sidebar/chatWebviewStyles.ts` owns the static sidebar CSS string.
- `src/highlighting/shikiCodeRenderer.ts` owns extension-host Shiki syntax rendering, VS Code theme/language registration resolution, fallback bundled Shiki themes/languages, and highlight-result caching.
- Browser-side sidebar logic lives under `src/webview` and is bundled by esbuild to `resources/webview/chat.js`; keep generated webview assets in `resources/webview`.
- `src/webview/main.ts` is only the browser-side composition entrypoint for shared state, top-level events, and the ready message.
- `src/webview/composer/` owns browser-side composer UI state: textarea sizing, submit/stop controls, model/thinking picker, prompt context badges, slash menu, and diff summary controls.
- `src/webview/messages/` owns browser-side message-list orchestration: incremental message rendering, message scrolling, busy status, and message click handling.
- `src/webview/sessions/` owns browser-side session list/tree UI, session-list command menus, top session title/menu, and related keyboard navigation.
- `src/webview/codeHighlighting.ts` owns browser-side asynchronous code-highlight requests/results for markdown code fences and read-tool code boxes; reuse it for future code/diff panes where practical.
- `src/webview/composer/diffCounter.ts` owns browser-side session diff counter formatting and animation.
- `src/webview/messages/renderMessages.ts`, `src/webview/messages/markdown.ts`, and `src/webview/messages/ansi.ts` own browser-side transcript rendering and markdown/ANSI output formatting.
- `src/webview/sessions/sessionFormat.ts` and `src/webview/sessions/sessionItemCommands.ts` own browser-side session row formatting and command metadata.
- `src/sidebar/nonce.ts` owns nonce generation for CSP-protected inline scripts.
- `src/pi/eventMapper.ts` owns pure Pi RPC event-to-UI action mapping helpers.
- `src/prompt/` owns one-shot IDE prompt context attachment types, state, normalization, labels, editor extraction, prompt formatting, and webview projection.
- `src/readyScript/` owns ready-script running, arming/queued-run state transitions, and shared ready-script types.
- `src/metadata/sessionMetadata.ts` owns session model/context/slash-command metadata state, refresh orchestration, formatting, and equality checks.
- `src/metadata/types.ts` owns shared metadata/cache type shapes; `src/metadata/cache.ts` owns persisted session metadata cache parsing/writing, including legacy cached model metadata migration.
- `src/extensionUi/requestHandler.ts` owns extension UI request routing through an injected VS Code UI adapter, safe cancellation, and stale request cleanup.
- `src/sessions/piSessionList.ts` owns extension-side discovery/parsing of persisted Pi session JSONL files for the sidebar session switcher.
- `src/sessions/piSessionTree.ts` owns extension-side parsing of persisted Pi session JSONL files for the in-session tree view.
- `src/pi/messageContent.ts` owns tolerant Pi message content text extraction shared by transcript and session readers.
- `src/pi/sessionJsonl.ts` owns tolerant Pi session JSONL record parsing shared by session-list, session-tree, and diff-history readers.
- `src/diff/sessionDiffController.ts` owns `PiChatController`'s session diff lifecycle: current session file binding, snapshot restore/save, refresh deduping, and state-post callbacks.
- `src/diff/sessionDiffTracker.ts` owns per-session changed-line baselines, net line diff stats, reconstructed per-file snapshot diffs, and recorded-edit fallback diffs for files modified through Pi edit/write tool executions; do not replace this with git diff for the sidebar counter or session changes view.
- `src/diff/sessionDiffViewer.ts` owns the first native session changes viewer: read-only virtual snapshot documents plus the VS Code multi-file diff adapter. Keep the adapter isolated so a future custom annotated diff UI can replace it.
- `src/diff/sessionDiffUri.ts` owns Tau session diff URI scheme/context helpers shared by the diff viewer and prompt-context extraction.
- `src/diff/sessionDiffStorage.ts` owns VS Code storage and file-watcher helpers for session diff snapshots/stat refresh.
- `src/slashCommands.ts` owns shared local slash command metadata used by both the extension host and browser webview.
- `src/rpc/client.ts` owns the `pi --mode rpc` subprocess, request/response tracking, stderr collection, and process cleanup; `src/rpc/protocol.ts` owns strict JSONL parsing/serialization; `src/rpc/types.ts` owns shared RPC and Pi result types.
- Third-party webview browser bundles are vendored in `resources/vendor`; generated first-party webview bundles live in `resources/webview`; keep browser-only libraries out of runtime `dependencies` unless extension-host code imports them.
- Shiki and `vscode-shiki-bridge` are runtime dependencies because syntax highlighting runs in the extension host, not as a vendored webview browser bundle.
- `.vscodeignore` must not exclude runtime `dependencies`; installed VSIX builds do not have the workspace `node_modules` available. Let `vsce` include production dependencies such as Shiki and its transitive packages.
- The extension host still compiles with direct `tsc`; browser-side webview code is bundled separately with esbuild through `npm run compile:webview`.

## Pi Integration

- Prefer `pi --mode rpc` for extension integration.
- Do not use `pi -p` / `--print` for the chat UI; it is one-shot and exits after a prompt.
- Do not use `pi --mode json` for the main chat UI; it streams events for a command-line prompt but is less suitable for a persistent IDE frontend.
- Do not add `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` SDK as a runtime dependency unless there is a clear reason to move away from the already configured CLI.
- Start Pi in the background when the sidebar opens, receives webview `ready`, is focused, or becomes visible so live model/context metadata is available before first interaction.
- Use the first VS Code workspace folder as the Pi process `cwd`.
- Treat the Pi agent as the source of truth for current model/settings; cached model, model-list, and context metadata are only first-paint placeholders and must be visibly refreshing until live RPC data confirms or replaces them.
- Preserve cached model/model-list metadata across new sessions, clear session-scoped context usage, and refresh live metadata immediately after starting the new session.
- Keep default Pi tool and session behavior unless the user explicitly asks for safer or ephemeral behavior.
- Stop the child process when the extension provider is disposed.

## Pi RPC Protocol Rules

- RPC mode is stdin/stdout JSONL.
- Commands go to stdin, responses and events come from stdout.
- Parse records by splitting only on LF (`\n`) and stripping a trailing CR (`\r`).
- Do not use Node `readline` for RPC output; it is not protocol-compliant for Pi RPC framing.
- Prompt commands use `{ "type": "prompt", "message": "..." }` and should include an `id` for response correlation.
- Restore sidebar history from Pi RPC `get_messages` after reconnecting to the persisted `sessionFile`; do not treat a locally cached transcript as the session source of truth.
- Track responses by `id`; events do not include request ids.
- Stream assistant text from `message_update` events where `assistantMessageEvent.type === "text_delta"`.
- Treat `agent_start` as busy and `agent_end` as idle.
- Surface failed command responses, parse failures, process exits, and stderr-backed startup failures in the UI.
- Route `extension_ui_request` handling through `ExtensionUiRequestHandler`; `select`, `confirm`, and `input` use VS Code-native UI, while unsupported dialog methods still receive `extension_ui_response` with `{ cancelled: true }` so Pi does not hang.
- Fire-and-forget `notify` requests can be shown with VS Code notifications.

## UI Guidelines

- Keep the sidebar simple, clean, and VS Code-native.
- Use VS Code theme CSS variables for colors, fonts, focus, inputs, buttons, and borders.
- Code highlighting uses Shiki asynchronously through the extension host. Do not reintroduce highlight.js unless explicitly requested.
- Keep Shiki highlighting failure-tolerant: code must remain readable as plain text if theme/language resolution or highlighting fails.
- Preserve the bundled Shiki fallback path in `src/highlighting/shikiCodeRenderer.ts`; it prevents read boxes from silently losing highlighting when VS Code theme/grammar resolution is unreliable.
- Keep transcript state in memory until persistence is explicitly requested.
- The sidebar `/resume` command opens the session switcher for switching session files. `/tree` opens a first-version in-session session tree view backed by the persisted JSONL session file and attempts navigation through Pi RPC `navigate_tree`; keep a graceful unsupported-RPC error until Pi exposes that command in released RPC builds.
- Disable submit while Pi is streaming; do not invent steering or follow-up queue behavior without a specific iteration goal.
- Avoid broad frontend rewrites. Preserve the existing webview structure unless the task requires changing it.

## Development Workflow

- Tests live in `src/test/suite` as TypeScript Mocha tests and run through `vscode-test`.
- Keep automated tests independent from the real `pi` CLI; test RPC framing and event mapping with local helpers or fixtures.
- Run `npm run compile` after TypeScript changes.
- Run `npm test` after changes to `src/chatSession.ts` or `src/pi/eventMapper.ts`.
- Use `git diff --check` before finishing edits.
- For UI behavior changes, manually verify in the VS Code Extension Host when practical.
- For syntax-highlighting changes, manually verify fresh and resumed read-tool boxes, markdown fenced code, theme switching, and unsupported-extension fallback.
- Keep changes small and scoped to the requested iteration.
- Do not touch unrelated files.
