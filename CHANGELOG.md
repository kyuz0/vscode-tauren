# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added Kward memory management through `/memory ...` and VS Code command palette actions.
- Added `/memory` Composer Suggestions for Kward memory options.
- Added Kward-backed Session Tree support with tree labels, navigation, filtering, search, folding, and label timestamp display.
- Added a `/restart` command that restarts open backend engines, reconnects persisted sessions, and refreshes session navigation.
- Added an experimental configurable Kward JSON-RPC backend for Tauren sidebar chat.

### Changed

- Clarified backend-neutral Runtime and Login settings copy while keeping Pi-specific extension settings explicit.
- Changed Kward memory slash command results to appear in the Transcript.
- Changed Login settings to derive authentication providers from the Pi runtime instead of Tauren-maintained built-in provider metadata.
- Wired the experimental Kward backend to the expanded RPC parity contract for images, runtime metadata, commands, auth, fork, and session listing.
- Show Kward's active persona label on new assistant transcript messages when provided by RPC runtime state.

### Fixed

- Removed the Kward experimental startup popup when opening new Kward sessions.
- Fixed the Session List Lane and Session Tree Lane so background renders no longer steal focus back from the editor or terminal.
- Reduced session diff file watcher subprocess churn by ignoring generated/vendor paths and directories during live workspace tracking.
- Fixed Login settings so API-key providers are shown and filtered with Pi `/login` parity.
- Fixed session changes so command-generated files and mixed reconstructable/non-reconstructable edits are included more reliably.
- Fixed external VS Code setting changes so every Tauren-owned setting refreshes the sidebar state immediately.
- Restricted `@` file suggestions to the active workspace cwd so absolute, home, or traversal prefixes cannot browse outside it.
- Fixed Kward `ask_user_question` answer delivery and keyboard-friendly question dialog behavior.
- Fixed Kward Session List Lane refreshes around newly created sessions so first-turn metadata can replace Tauren's temporary fallback row.
- Hide the Composer Footer when no extension status or footer plugin claims the Footer space.
- Fixed Kward model and thinking selections so the sidebar updates immediately while slower metadata refreshes continue in the background.
- Fixed Kward model picker options when the backend reports scoped model cycling as unsupported.
- Fixed Kward live reasoning blocks so separated reasoning phases no longer collapse into one transcript entry.
- Fixed Kward RPC session switching to use active RPC session IDs and ignore stale old-session responses.
- Recovered Kward metadata reads when the backend has already closed Tauren's cached RPC session.
- Fixed Kward startup session restore so concurrent metadata/history requests share one resumed RPC session.
- Fixed explicit Kward new sessions so they bypass backend auto-resume and always create a fresh session.
- Fixed empty unnamed Kward sessions so they refresh the Session List Lane when left and are not remembered for startup reconnection.
- Fixed Kward Session List RPC loading to request the full backend list instead of the previous 100-session cap.
- Fixed Kward session deletion when RPC capabilities list `sessions/delete` without a top-level supported flag.
- Added Tauren bridge handling for Kward RPC footer notifications so Kward plugin footers can render in the Footer.
- Fixed Kward compaction status updates from the current `session/event` RPC notification channel.
- Routed Kward Session List deletion through the backend `sessions/delete` RPC method.
- Closed temporary Kward background RPC sessions through `sessions/close` when supported.
- Mapped newer Kward turn lifecycle and metadata RPC events into Tauren-compatible events.
- Warn when Kward reports an unexpected RPC protocol version during initialization.
- Capability-gated Kward RPC session listing before falling back to local session files.
- Extracted Kward RPC launch resolution in preparation for additional Kward launch modes.
- Allowed Kward path to point at an executable file launched directly with `rpc`.
- Clarified Kward path setting copy for source-directory and executable launch modes.
- Filtered Pi-owned settings from the Kward Settings view unless Kward reports current values for them.
- Added an empty state for Kward Settings sections with no Kward-supported settings.
- Added coverage for Kward-specific Settings filtering.
- Documented experimental Kward backend setup and trusted-local behavior.
