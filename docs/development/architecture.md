# Architecture

Tauren is a VS Code extension with a native sidebar-style webview UI. It hosts the Pi coding agent through the bundled Pi SDK runtime and keeps transport details behind Tauren's own client contracts.

## High-level shape

```text
VS Code extension host
├─ Tauren provider/controller
├─ Pi SDK client bridge
├─ session, diff, metadata, prompt, and settings services
└─ webview HTML + bundled browser code
```

The extension host owns VS Code integration. The browser webview owns interaction rendering. Pi owns agent runtime behavior.

## Extension shell

`src/extension.ts` is intentionally small. It activates commands and views, then delegates real work to the provider and controller layers.

`package.json` defines:

- contributed commands,
- the Tauren Activity Bar view,
- configuration settings,
- keybindings,
- build and test scripts.

## Provider and controller

`src/taurenChatViewProvider.ts` owns VS Code webview/provider integration:

- focus and visibility,
- webview lifecycle,
- workspace `cwd`,
- notifications,
- Tauren session-manager lifecycle.

`src/taurenChatController.ts` owns chat orchestration. Supporting controller code under `src/controller/` handles parsing, type guards, error classification, transcript formatting, local slash commands, Pi lifecycle, and event handling.

## Webview

Browser code lives under `src/webview` and bundles to `resources/webview/chat.js`.

The extension host composes webview HTML in `src/sidebar/chatWebview.ts`; static sidebar CSS lives in `src/sidebar/chatWebviewStyles.ts` and `src/sidebar/styles/`.

## Sessions

Tauren keeps session state separate from VS Code and Pi process details. `src/chat/chatSession.ts` is pure in-memory transcript/session state.

Open-session coordination lives in `src/sessions/taurenSessionManager.ts`, with supporting session view, history, formatting, and client-action helpers under `src/sessions/`.

## Pi transport

Tauren uses the bundled Pi SDK runtime. SDK loading, event mapping, and bridge code live under `src/sdk/` and `src/pi/`.

Do not reintroduce `pi --mode rpc` for the main chat UI. The SDK transport is the supported architecture.

## Diff lifecycle

Session diff behavior lives under `src/diff/`. Tauren tracks session-specific changes rather than using Git as the sidebar diff source.

## Build outputs

- Extension host TypeScript compiles to `out/`.
- Browser webview bundle outputs to `resources/webview/chat.js`.
- SDK runtime bundle outputs to `out/sdk/piSdkBundle.mjs` and runtime assets under `resources/pi-sdk-runtime/`.
- Documentation builds to `docs/.vitepress/dist/`, which is ignored.

## Design rule

Keep ownership boundaries clear. Extension-host code should own VS Code integration, browser code should own DOM interaction, and Pi should remain the source of truth for agent runtime behavior.
