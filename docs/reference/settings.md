# Settings

This page lists Tauren-owned VS Code settings. Pi-owned runtime settings are available inside the Tauren settings UI and are stored by Pi.

The **Settings pane** column shows where the same control appears inside Tauren: `Settings category → Human readable name`.

## Appearance

| Setting | Settings pane | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tauren.outputColors` | Appearance → Output colors | `true` | Enable ANSI and syntax colors in Tauren output boxes. When disabled, ANSI escape sequences are stripped. |
| `tauren.animationsEnabled` | Appearance → Animations | `true` | Enable animations in the Tauren sidebar. Reduced-motion preferences still disable motion. |
| `tauren.showWelcome` | Appearance → Welcome message | `true` | Show the Welcome to Tauren empty state for new chats. |
| `tauren.customUiTheme` | Appearance → Custom UI theme | `default` | Visual theme for Pi extension custom UI terminal panels. Options: `default`, `modern`, `crt`, `amber`, `matrix`. |

| `tauren.rejectEditWriteOutsideWorkspace` | Safety → Reject external edits | `false` | Reject Pi edit/write tool mutations outside the active workspace folder. This does not restrict shell commands. |

## Advanced

## Pi runtime settings

The Tauren settings UI also exposes Pi-owned runtime controls such as provider, model, thinking level, compaction, retry, steering, follow-up behavior, image handling, enabled models, and skill commands.

Pi remains the source of truth for those values. Tauren displays and edits them through the SDK runtime.
