# Hotkeys

Run `/hotkeys` inside Tauren to print the live shortcut list. This page documents the default interaction model.

## Custom VS Code keybindings

Tauren scopes its default VS Code keybindings with the when-clause context key `tauren.sidebarFocus`.
Use that context when adding your own Tauren sidebar shortcuts in `keybindings.json`:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+shift+c",
  "command": "tauren.copyLastResponse",
  "when": "tauren.sidebarFocus"
}
```

VS Code may not autocomplete `tauren.sidebarFocus` in the Keyboard Shortcuts UI or `keybindings.json`.
This is expected: Tauren sets the key dynamically at runtime with VS Code's `setContext` API, and VS Code's when-clause suggestions only include statically known context keys. The key is still valid when typed manually.
