# Tau

Tau is a VS Code frontend extension for the [Pi coding agent](https://pi.dev).

It gives Pi a native-feeling UI inside VS Code: open the Tau icon in the Activity Bar, type a prompt, and work with the same Pi sessions, models, tools, and project context without switching back to a terminal.

Tau is not a separate agent. It starts Pi in RPC mode and talks to the Pi CLI running on your machine.

## What it does

- Adds a Tau panel to the VS Code Activity Bar.
- Streams Pi responses in the Tau chat view.
- Shows tool activity, progress, errors, and assistant output.
- Uses your first workspace folder as Pi's working directory.
- Lets you switch models and thinking level from the Tau view.
- Shows live context usage when Pi reports it.
- Supports Pi sessions: new, resume, fork, clone, compact, export, and session info.
- Lets you add the active file or selected code as prompt context from VS Code.
- Uses VS Code UI for Pi prompts such as selects, confirms, inputs, and notifications.

## Requirements

Tau needs the Pi CLI installed separately.

```sh
npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
```

Then set up Pi the same way you would for terminal use:

```sh
pi
/login
```

Or configure provider API keys in your shell environment. See [pi.dev](https://pi.dev) for Pi's setup instructions and supported providers.

By default Tau runs `pi`. If Pi is not on VS Code's PATH, set `tau.piPath` in VS Code settings, for example:

```json
{
  "tau.piPath": "/opt/homebrew/bin/pi"
}
```

## Using Tau

Open the Tau icon in the Activity Bar, then type normally.

Useful commands are also available from the Command Palette:

- `Tau: Focus on Tau`
- `Tau: New Session`
- `Tau: Resume Session`
- `Tau: Fork Session`
- `Tau: Clone Session`
- `Tau: Add Context`

You can also right-click in an editor and choose `Add Context`. If text is selected, Tau attaches the selection. If nothing is selected, it attaches the current file.

Double-click the session title in Tau's toolbar to rename the current session inline.

## Keyboard navigation

Tau-specific keys inside the sidebar:

| Key                             | Where                        | Action                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `Enter`                         | Prompt                       | Send the prompt.                                    |
| `Shift+Enter`                   | Prompt                       | Insert a newline.                                   |
| `Cmd+N` / `Ctrl+N`              | Anywhere in Tau              | Start a new session.                                |
| `PageUp` / `PageDown`           | Chat                         | Scroll the transcript by page.                      |
| `Ctrl+PageUp` / `Ctrl+PageDown` | Chat                         | Scroll the transcript by line.                      |
| `Esc`                           | Prompt, with no popup open   | Open the session list.                              |
| `Esc`                           | Session list or session tree | Return to the current session and focus the prompt. |
| `ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown`         | Session list or session tree | Move the selected row.                              |
| `Enter`                         | Session list or session tree | Open the selected session or tree entry.            |
| `Delete` / `Backspace`          | Session list                 | Delete the selected session if it is deletable.     |
| `ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown`         | Slash command menu           | Move the selected command.                          |
| `Tab`                           | Slash command menu           | Insert the selected command.                        |
| `Enter`                         | Slash command menu           | Insert the selected command.                        |
| `Esc`                           | Slash command menu           | Close the menu.                                     |
| `Enter`                         | Inline session naming        | Save the session name.                              |
| `Esc`                           | Inline session naming        | Cancel editing and focus the prompt.                |

`Esc` is intentionally overloaded as Tau's back key. It first closes the most local UI you opened: slash command menu, model picker, top-bar session menu, or inline session naming. If there is nothing local to close and the prompt is focused, `Esc` opens the session list. Press `Esc` again from the session list to return to chat, so you can toggle between writing and session navigation with one key.

## Slash commands

Tau supports the Pi slash commands that make sense in the VS Code UI today:

```text
/new
/resume
/model
/name
/session
/tree
/fork
/clone
/copy
/compact
/reload
/export
```

Some Pi terminal commands are not wired into Tau yet. When that happens, Tau will tell you rather than trying to fake it.

## Settings

### `tau.piPath`

Command used to launch Pi. This can be an executable name or a full command, such as:

- `pi`
- `/opt/homebrew/bin/pi`
- `npx pi`
- `"/path with spaces/pi"`

### `tau.fullRpcAgentCommunication`

Shows the full RPC conversation in the transcript. Most users should leave this off. It is mainly useful while debugging Tau or Pi RPC behavior.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run compile
```
