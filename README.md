# Tau

Tau is a transparent AI coding assistant for VS Code focused on session-based workflows and code traceability.

## Philosophy

Tau follows the same direction as [Pi](https://pi.dev), the backend agent engine it builds on:

- full insight into every tool call
- no hidden prompts
- no black magic

If your clanker followed Order 66 again, Tau will at least show you exactly what happened.

## Features

### Trace Origin

Jump from code back to the historical agent session that created it.

Tau can reconnect:

- current code
- historical agent context
- related Git commits
- reasoning history

Even across refactors and file moves.

### Session Diffs

Create scrollable diffs showing all changes made during a session.

### What else?

Tau builds on top of Pi's existing capabilities:

- tree-based session management
- plugin ecosystem
- resumable sessions
- transparent tool execution

It also adds parallel session workflows, allowing you to switch between multiple active sessions without losing context.

The focus is not to hide complexity, but to make agentic coding workflows easier to navigate.

## Requirements / Setup

Install Pi if you haven't already:

```sh
npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
```

Then set it up the same way you would for terminal use:

```sh
pi
/login
```

For more information, read the [documentation here](https://pi.dev/docs/latest).

## Using Tau

Tau is heavily keyboard-oriented.

The most important key is probably `Esc`:

- from the prompt → opens the session list
- from the session list → returns to the current session

Everything else is mostly discoverable. You'll figure out the rest anyway.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run compile
```

Run tests with:

```sh
npm test
```

For local development in VS Code, launch the extension host from the provided VS Code launch configuration.
